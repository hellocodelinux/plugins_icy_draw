# IcyDraw
IcyDraw is the successor of MysticDraw, an ANSI drawing tool I developed in 1996 and last updated in 2003. Due to lack of feedback, I lost interest there. Now, 20 years later, I've decided to give it an update, and here it is.

These plugins can work in the selected area. If no area is selected, they will use the entire workspace.
