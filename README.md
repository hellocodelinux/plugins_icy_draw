- **grid_pattern.lua**
  - Draws a grid pattern using plus, minus, and pipe characters (`┼`). Useful for creating structured layouts.

- **horizontal_gradient.lua**
  - Draws a horizontal gradient pattern using a range of block characters with varying densities (`█`, `▓`, `▒`, `░`). Ideal for smooth transitions.

- **horizontal_stripes.lua**
  - Draws a horizontal striped pattern using block characters (`█` and ` `). Adds a layered look to your artwork.

- **increase_intensity.lua**
  - Replaces blocks with a more dense block, respecting the original block's color. Useful for enhancing the intensity of your artwork.
  - ` ` → `░`, `░` → `▒`, `▒` → `▓`, `▓` → `█`

- **lower_intensity.lua**
  - Replaces blocks with a less dense block, respecting the original block's color. Useful for reducing the intensity of your artwork.
  - `█` → `▓`, `▓` → `▒`, `▒` → `░`, `░` → ` `

- **random_blocks.lua**
  - Draws a random block fill pattern using various block characters (`█`, `▓`, `▒`, `░`). Creates a chaotic, pixelated effect.

- **random_half_blocks.lua**
  - Draws a random half-block fill pattern using half-block characters (`▀`, `▄`, `▌`, `▐`). Adds a textured, semi-transparent look.

  - Draws a random color fill pattern using ANSI color codes. Perfect for vibrant, colorful backgrounds.

- **shadow_effect.lua**
  - This script creates a shadow effect by adding a dotted block (`░`) to the right of each solid block (`█`). Enhances depth and dimension.

- **vertical_gradient.lua**
  - Draws a vertical gradient pattern using a range of block characters with varying densities (`█`, `▓`, `▒`, `░`). Ideal for smooth vertical transitions.

- **vertical_stripes.lua**
  - Draws a vertical striped pattern using block characters (`█` and ` `). Adds a layered look to your artwork.

- **matrix_pattern.lua**
  - Creates the iconic Matrix digital rain effect using Japanese katakana and Latin characters in bright green. Perfect for cyberpunk-style animations and backgrounds (`ﾊ`, `ﾐ`, `ﾋ`, `ｰ`, `ｳ`, `ｼ`, etc.).

- **vertical_mirror.lua**
  - Creates a vertical mirror copy outside of a rectangular region. Useful for creating symmetrical designs.
